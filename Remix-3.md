# Remix 1

I will use the `filter` function.

```JavaScript
const count_true4 = (lst) => {
  return lst.filter((item) => item === true).length;
};
```

## Strategy

I will use ChatGPT to analize the different solutions, I want to have a compact solution.

## Implementation

In this implementation, the filter method is used to create a new array containing only the elements that are equal to `true``. Then, we return the length of the filtered array, which represents the count of true values in the original array lst. This implementation should give the same result as the original script.

## Possible refactors

- Use an arrow function
- Move all the test functions in a separated folder and import them
- Clean up the tests
